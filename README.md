# "Saasovation" - a "Jira"-like project management system

This project implements features required for a project management system. It enables company members to register, login, create new project boards, new tickets, add members to the task and to the team.

## Built With

* [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - an open source Java-based framework.
* [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) -  an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) -  an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.
* [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) -  a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments.


## Getting Started
Spring Boot can be used with “classic” Java development tools or installed as a command line tool. Either way, you need Java SDK v1.8 or higher. Before you begin, you should check your current Java installation by using the following command:

```
$ java -version
```
